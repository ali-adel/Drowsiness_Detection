## Project Overview

The HOR project aims to enhance safety and awareness by effectively detecting drowsiness in various environments. By analyzing facial features in real-time, the model can alert users when signs of drowsiness are detected, making it a valuable tool for drivers, operators, and other professionals.

## Website

The HOR website provides an interactive platform for users to experience our drowsiness detection capabilities. Key features include:

- **Image Prediction:** Upload images to analyze facial features indicative of drowsiness.
- **Video Prediction:** Upload videos to monitor drowsiness levels over time.
- **Live Streaming Analysis:** Connect live camera feeds for continuous monitoring and instant alerts.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy navigation for all users.
- **Model Insights:** Detailed information about the underlying technology and performance metrics.
